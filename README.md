# Portfolio Page

The portfolio itself has been built with React. It is meant to be a one page fitting the entire browser window and that will change its display upon clicking on the different section handlers.

It welcomes visitors with a custom made animation built through an SVG object and a series of different keyframes with different delay times.

Both the animation and page are meant to be entirely responsive without using any bootstrap of jquery.
